## Stage 1: Signup Steps Reporting

Currently implementing a dashboard to track player signup progress across multiple data sources:

- SPS Final Forms completion status
- Additional questionnaire responses  
- Team mailing list membership

See `PLAN.md` for detailed implementation progress.

## Google API Setup

This application requires access to Google Sheets and Google Drive to fetch player signup data. Follow these steps to set up API access:

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Note your project ID for reference

### 2. Enable Required APIs

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
2. Search for and enable:
   - **Google Sheets API**
   - **Google Drive API**

### 3. Create Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in the service account details:
   - Name: `madison-ultimate-service`
   - Description: `Service account for Madison Ultimate app data access`
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip role assignment (we'll grant access directly to resources)
6. Click "Done"

### 4. Generate Service Account Key

1. Click on the newly created service account
2. Go to the "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
4. Select "JSON" format
5. Download the JSON key file
6. Rename it to `.google-service-account.json`
7. Place it in the root of your project directory

### 5. Grant Access to Data Sources

You must share each Google resource with the service account email (found in the JSON key file):

**For Google Sheets:**
1. Open the [Additional Questionnaire sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_PPULjdg-5q2Gi0cXvWvGz1RbwYmUtADChLqwsHuNs/)
2. Click "Share" button
3. Add the service account email (e.g., `service-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
4. Set permission to "Viewer"
5. Uncheck "Notify people" since it's a service account

**For Google Drive Folders:**
1. Open [SPS Final Forms folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SnWCxDIn3FxJCvd1JcWyoeoOMscEsQcW)
2. Right-click folder > "Share"
3. Add the service account email with "Viewer" permission
4. Repeat for [Team Mailing List folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pAeQMEqiA9QdK9G5yRXsqgbNVzEU7R1E)

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Update the file path in `.env.local` to point to your service account key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE=./.google-service-account.json
   ```

### 7. Security Notes

- The `.google-service-account.json` file contains sensitive credentials
- It's automatically ignored by git (listed in `.gitignore`)
- Never commit this file to version control
- For production deployment, use secure environment variable storage
