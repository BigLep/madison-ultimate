# Madison Ultimate App - Technical Design

This document outlines the technical implementation details, data processing pipeline, and architectural decisions for the Madison Ultimate signup tracking application.

## Core Design Philosophy: Family-Centric Multi-Player Support

### Primary Design Goal
A fundamental design principle of this application is to make it **easy for families to manage multiple players from the same household**. Many families have multiple children participating in Madison Ultimate, and the system is architected to accommodate this reality seamlessly.

### Family-Friendly Features

#### Player-Specific PWAs (Progressive Web Apps)
- **Individual App Installations**: Each player gets their own installable PWA with personalized naming
- **App Name Format**: "Madison Ultimate - [Player Name]" (e.g., "Madison Ultimate - Alex Smith")
- **Separate App Icons**: Each family member appears as a distinct app on home screens and app drawers
- **Independent Management**: Parents can install separate apps for each child, making it easy to switch between players

#### Dynamic Page Titles for Easy Bookmarking
- **Player-Specific Titles**: Browser tabs and bookmarks show "Madison Ultimate - [Player Name]"
- **Easy Identification**: When multiple tabs/bookmarks are open, parents can quickly identify which child's portal they're viewing
- **Bookmark Organization**: Browser bookmarks automatically organize by player name

#### Portal-Based Architecture
- **Unique URLs**: Each player has their own portal ID (e.g., `/player-portal/abc123`)
- **Direct Access**: Parents can bookmark or share direct links to specific player portals
- **Independent Sessions**: Multiple browser tabs can be open for different players simultaneously

### Technical Implementation

#### PWA Manifest Generation
- **Dynamic API**: `/api/manifest/[portalId]` generates player-specific manifests
- **Personalized Metadata**: Each app has unique name, short name, and start URL
- **Scoped Installation**: Each PWA is scoped to its specific player portal

#### Page Title Management
- **Dynamic Updates**: `document.title` changes based on logged-in player
- **Cleanup on Navigation**: Title resets when leaving player-specific areas
- **Bookmark-Friendly**: Consistent naming for easy identification

### User Experience Benefits

#### For Parents Managing Multiple Players
- **Clear Visual Separation**: Each child appears as a distinct app
- **Quick Switching**: Easy to jump between children's information
- **Reduced Confusion**: No accidental cross-player data entry
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch-optimized interface for parent devices

#### For Families with Multiple Players
- **Scalable Design**: Works equally well for 1 child or 5+ children
- **Independent Tracking**: Each player's availability, forms, and info managed separately
- **Shared Device Support**: Multiple family members can use the same device with distinct experiences

### Design Decisions Rationale

#### Why Player-Specific PWAs Instead of Multi-Player Dashboard?
- **Cognitive Load**: Separate apps reduce mental overhead when managing specific player's needs
- **Mobile UX**: Dedicated apps feel more native and focused on mobile devices
- **Future Notifications**: Player-specific push notifications become possible
- **Sharing**: Easy to share specific player's portal with other caregivers (grandparents, etc.)

#### Why Portal-Based URLs?
- **Bookmarkability**: Parents can bookmark each child's portal independently
- **Direct Links**: Coaches can send player-specific links
- **Security**: Portal IDs provide secure, unguessable access without complex authentication
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns per player for future improvements

### Future Family-Centric Enhancements
- **Family Dashboard**: Optional overview showing all family players
- **Cross-Player Calendar**: Combined view of all children's games/practices
- **Batch Operations**: Update availability for multiple players simultaneously
- **Parent Notifications**: Push notifications about upcoming events for any family player

This family-centric approach ensures Madison Ultimate scales naturally with families and adapts to real-world usage patterns, reducing friction for busy parents managing multiple young athletes.

## Data Source Mapping

The application integrates data from three sources to create a comprehensive signup status report. Here's the exact mapping from source columns to report columns:

| Report Column | Data Source | Source Column | Data Type | Validation Logic |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Player First Name** | SPS Final Forms | `"First Name"` | String | Direct mapping |
| **Player Last Name** | SPS Final Forms | `"Last Name"` | String | Direct mapping |
| **Player Grade** | SPS Final Forms | `"Grade"` | String | Direct mapping |
| **Player Gender** | SPS Final Forms | `"Gender"` | String | Direct mapping |
| **Has Caretaker Signed Final Forms** | SPS Final Forms | `"Are All Forms Parent Signed"` | String → Boolean | `=== 'true'` |
| **Has Player Signed Final Forms** | SPS Final Forms | `"Are All Forms Student Signed"` | String → Boolean | `=== 'true'` |
| **Does Player Have a Cleared Physical** | SPS Final Forms | `"Physical Clearance"` | String → Boolean | `=== 'Cleared'` |
| **Has Caretaker filled out Questionnaire** | Additional Questionnaire | `"Player Name (First & Last)"` | String → Boolean | Fuzzy name matching (>80% confidence) |
| **Has Caretaker 1 joined Mailing List** | Final Forms → Team Mailing List | `"Parent 1 Email"` → `"Email address"` | String → Boolean | Exact email match |
| **Has Caretaker 2 joined Mailing List** | Final Forms → Team Mailing List | `"Parent 2 Email"` → `"Email address"` | String → Boolean | Exact email match |

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Google Service Account (server-side)
- **Data Sources**: Google Sheets API + Google Drive API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
1. Data Fetching (with Caching)
   ├── SPS Final Forms (CSV from Google Drive)
   ├── Team Mailing List (CSV from Google Drive) 
   └── Additional Questionnaire (Google Sheets)
   └── Cache Manager handles all API calls

2. Data Parsing
   ├── CSV parsing with multi-line field handling
   ├── Boolean conversion from strings
   └── Email extraction and normalization

3. Data Integration
   ├── Primary key: Player name from Final Forms
   ├── Fuzzy name matching for questionnaire
   ├── Email matching for mailing list
   └── Status calculation per player

4. Caching & Output
   ├── Store processed data in /tmp/integrated-data.json
   ├── Background refresh every 30 minutes
   ├── Stale-while-revalidate strategy
   └── PlayerSignupStatus[] with completion flags
```

### Fuzzy Matching Algorithm

Uses Levenshtein distance for name matching:
- **Similarity calculation**: `(maxLength - distance) / maxLength`
- **Confidence threshold**: 80% for questionnaire matching
- **Weighting**: First name (30%) + Last name (70%)

### Data Models

#### Core Types
```typescript
interface PlayerSignupStatus {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  grade: string;
  gender: string;
  hasCaretakerSignedFinalForms: boolean;
  hasPlayerSignedFinalForms: boolean;
  hasPlayerClearedPhysical: boolean;
  hasCaretakerFilledQuestionnaire: boolean;
  hasCaretaker1JoinedMailingList: boolean;
  hasCaretaker2JoinedMailingList: boolean;
}
```

#### Source Data Types
```typescript
interface SPSFinalFormsRecord {
  playerFirstName: string;
  playerLastName: string;
  playerGrade: string;
  playerGender: string;
  caretaker1Email: string;
  caretaker2Email: string;
  parentsSignedStatus: boolean;
  studentsSignedStatus: boolean;
  physicalClearanceStatus: boolean;
}

interface MailingListRecord {
  email: string;
  name: string;
  joinedDate: string;
}

interface QuestionnaireRecord {
  playerFirstName: string;
  playerLastName: string;
  caretakerEmail: string;
  submissionTimestamp: string;
}
```

## Caching Strategy

### Simplified In-Memory Caching

The application uses a simple in-memory caching strategy optimized for Vercel's serverless environment:

#### **Cache Manager Features**
- **Cache Duration**: 2 minutes (hardcoded for optimal balance)
- **Storage Location**: In-memory Map (no disk persistence)
- **Refresh Strategy**: On-demand only (no background tasks)
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Serves stale cache if Google APIs fail
- **Force Refresh**: Debug endpoints trigger fresh data fetch

#### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Memory Cache Hit**: ~10-20ms response time
- **Cache Miss**: ~3-5 seconds (Google API calls + processing)
- **API Usage Reduction**: ~80-90% fewer Google API calls
- **Container Persistence**: Cache survives between requests when container is reused
- **Cold Start Behavior**: Fresh fetch on new container deployment

#### **Cache Behavior**
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Scenario        │ Action           │ Response Time   │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Memory hit      │ Serve from RAM   │ ~10-20ms       │
│ Cache expired   │ Fetch + cache    │ ~3-5 seconds   │
│ API failure     │ Serve stale      │ ~10-20ms       │
│ Cold start      │ Fresh fetch      │ ~3-5 seconds   │
│ Debug endpoint  │ Force refresh    │ ~3-5 seconds   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

#### **Vercel Serverless Optimizations**
- **No Background Timers**: Eliminates unreliable setInterval() in serverless
- **No Disk I/O**: Avoids ephemeral file system writes
- **Container Reuse**: Leverages Vercel's container persistence when available
- **Fast Response**: 2-minute cache balances freshness with performance

## API Endpoints

### `/api/players` (Main Data API)
- **Purpose**: Serve integrated player signup data
- **Caching**: Uses in-memory cache with 2-minute expiry
- **Response**: Complete PlayerSignupStatus[] with statistics
- **Performance**: ~10-20ms (cached) / ~3-5s (fresh)

### `/api/debug` (Debug & Force Refresh)
- **Purpose**: Email matching analysis + force cache refresh
- **Caching**: Always fetches fresh data and updates memory cache
- **Response**: Matched/unmatched email breakdown
- **Usage**: Troubleshooting email matching issues

### Legacy Endpoints (Deprecated)
- `/api/test-google` - Replaced by cache manager
- `/api/test-data-processing` - Replaced by main data pipeline  
- `/api/cache-data` - Replaced by automatic caching
- `/api/debug-mailing-list` - Replaced by `/api/debug`

## Data Source Details

## Stage 3: Player Portal UI Framework Decision

### Selected Framework: shadcn/ui

For the Stage 3 Player Portal implementation, we selected **shadcn/ui** as our primary UI component library. This decision prioritizes maintainability, industry standards, and long-term sustainability.

#### Why shadcn/ui?

**1. Industry Standard & Proven Track Record**
- Used by major companies: Vercel, Linear, Resend, and thousands of open-source projects
- Over 40,000 GitHub stars with active development
- Trusted by enterprise and startup teams alike

**2. Not Bespoke - Built on Proven Foundations**
- Built on **Radix UI primitives** (the gold standard for accessible React components)
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** (which we already use in the project)
- Leverages **class-variance-authority** for component variants
- No custom framework - just industry-standard building blocks

**3. Copy-Paste Architecture (You Own the Code)**
- Components are copied directly into your codebase (`src/components/ui/`)
- No runtime dependencies or black-box libraries
- Full control over customization and modifications
- Never locked into a framework - you own the components

**4. Perfect Integration with Existing Stack**
- Native Tailwind CSS integration (no CSS-in-JS conflicts)
- TypeScript-first with full type safety
- Next.js App Router compatible
- Works seamlessly with existing project structure

**5. Accessibility & Mobile-First**
- Built-in ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- Screen reader optimized
- Mobile-responsive by default
- Follows WAI-ARIA guidelines

**6. Developer Experience**
- Excellent documentation with copy-paste examples
- CLI tools for easy component installation
- Consistent API patterns across all components
- Hot-reloading and dev tools support

#### Alternatives Considered & Why They Were Rejected

**Material-UI (MUI)**
- ❌ Heavy bundle size (200kb+ runtime)
- ❌ Google Material Design doesn't fit our app aesthetic
- ❌ Complex theming system with CSS-in-JS overhead
- ❌ Runtime styling performance impact

**Ant Design**
- ❌ Enterprise-focused design language (too corporate)
- ❌ Large bundle size and Chinese company dependencies
- ❌ Less flexibility for custom styling
- ❌ Desktop-first design approach

**Mantine**
- ✅ Good alternative with similar philosophy
- ❌ Smaller community and ecosystem
- ❌ Less battle-tested in production environments
- ❌ More opinionated styling approach

**Chakra UI**
- ✅ Good developer experience
- ❌ CSS-in-JS performance overhead
- ❌ Less momentum in the React community
- ❌ More complex setup with Next.js App Router

**Headless UI + Custom Components**
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ❌ Requires significant custom development time
- ❌ Reinventing the wheel for common patterns
- ❌ Inconsistent design system without significant effort

#### Technical Implementation Strategy

**Component Installation Pattern**
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add form
npx shadcn-ui@latest add navigation-menu
```

**File Structure**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                    # shadcn/ui components (copy-paste)
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   ├── form.tsx
│   │   └── navigation-menu.tsx
│   └── portal/                # Custom portal components
│       ├── player-info.tsx
│       ├── availability-calendar.tsx
│       └── portal-navigation.tsx
```

**Customization Strategy**
- Modify copied components directly for project-specific needs
- Use Tailwind CSS custom classes for brand colors and spacing
- Extend component variants using class-variance-authority patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing project styling

#### Long-term Maintainability

**Why This Choice Supports Maintainability:**
1. **Industry Standard**: Easy to find developers familiar with shadcn/ui
2. **No Vendor Lock-in**: Components live in your codebase
3. **Gradual Migration**: Can replace individual components as needed
4. **Community Support**: Large ecosystem and extensive documentation
5. **Future-Proof**: Built on stable, well-maintained foundations

**Risk Mitigation:**
- No runtime dependencies means no breaking changes from external updates
- Copy-paste architecture allows incremental improvements
- Tailwind CSS ensures styling remains maintainable
- TypeScript provides compile-time safety for component APIs

This decision aligns with the project requirement to use "popular, common web frameworks" while avoiding bespoke solutions. shadcn/ui provides the perfect balance of functionality, maintainability, and industry adoption for the Madison Ultimate Player Portal.

## Player Authentication & Identification

### Portal ID vs Player Name Lookup Strategy

The application uses a hybrid approach for player identification to balance security and simplicity:

#### Initial Portal Access
- **Route**: `/player-portal/{playerPortalId}`
- **Method**: Portal ID lookup via `findPortalEntryByPortalId()`
- **Purpose**: Secure initial authentication to verify the player has access
- **Data Source**: Portal cache (roster sheet Portal columns)

#### Subsequent API Calls
- **Routes**: `/api/practice/{portalId}` (POST), `/api/other-features/{portalId}` (POST)
- **Method**: Full name passed in request body
- **Purpose**: Direct sheet operations without repeated portal cache lookups
- **Rationale**: This is a casual webapp - simplicity over robustness

#### Design Benefits
1. **Security**: Portal ID required for initial access
2. **Simplicity**: POST requests use human-readable full names
3. **Performance**: Avoids portal cache lookups on every mutation
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between authentication and operations

#### Example Flow
```
1. User visits: /player-portal/8l06b12
2. System validates portal ID "8l06b12" → finds "Eli Loeppky"
3. User submits practice availability
4. Frontend sends: { fullName: "Eli Loeppky", availability: "👍 Planning to be there" }
5. Backend finds "Eli Loeppky" in Practice Availability sheet
```

### Data Sources for Player Portal

#### Portal Cache
- **Source**: Roster sheet Portal columns (Lookup Key, Portal ID)
- **Purpose**: Map portal IDs to player lookup keys
- **Usage**: Initial authentication only

#### Player Data
- **Source**: Full roster sheet via `/api/player/{portalId}`
- **Purpose**: Complete player information
- **Usage**: Displaying player details

#### Practice Availability
- **Source**: Practice Availability sheet
- **Key**: Full Name column
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve practice attendance responses

### Authentication Philosophy for Player Portal

This is designed as a casual team management app, not a high-security system. The portal ID serves as a simple access token - if you have the URL, you can access that player's portal. This design prioritizes:

- **Ease of use**: Parents/players just need to bookmark their portal URL
- **Simplicity**: Minimal authentication overhead
- **Maintainability**: Straightforward troubleshooting and support

For a production system requiring higher security, consider implementing proper user accounts, sessions, and role-based access control.

## Date Formatting Standards

### Centralized Date Formatting Strategy

The application uses a consistent date formatting approach to eliminate user confusion about event timing:

#### Design Decision: Always Include Day of Week
- **Problem**: Dates like "September 23" don't indicate which day of the week the event occurs
- **Solution**: Always display as "Tuesday, September 23" format
- **Implementation**: Centralized utilities in `/src/lib/date-formatters.ts`

#### Available Formatters
- `formatFullDate()` - **Primary**: "Tuesday, September 23"
- `formatShortDate()` - **Mobile/limited space**: "Tue, Sep 23"
- `formatFullDateWithYear()` - **Cross-year events**: "Tuesday, September 23, 2024"

#### Usage Pattern
```typescript
import { formatFullDate } from '@/lib/date-formatters';

// Practice dates
const practiceDate = formatFullDate("9/23"); // "Tuesday, September 23"

// Game dates (upcoming)
const gameDate = formatFullDate("10/5"); // "Saturday, October 5"
```

#### Benefits
1. **User Clarity**: Parents/players immediately know which day events occur
2. **Consistency**: Same format across practices, games, and all features
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for date formatting logic
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Short format available when space is constrained

This standardization is especially important for sports scheduling where day-of-week matters significantly for planning attendance.

## PWA Icon Management

### Files That Need to Change When Updating PWA Icons

When updating the application's PWA (Progressive Web App) icons, the following files require updates to ensure icons display correctly across all platforms and contexts:

#### 1. PWA Manifest Generation
**File**: `src/app/api/manifest/[portalId]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generates player-specific PWA manifests
- **Icon References**: Array of icon objects with src, sizes, type, and purpose
- **Platform Focus**: Android launcher icons (typically 48x48 to 512x512)
- **Cache Busting**: Increment `MANIFEST_VERSION` to force browser refresh

#### 2. Next.js Layout Metadata
**File**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Global favicon and Apple touch icons via Next.js metadata API
- **Icon References**: `metadata.icons.icon` (favicon) and `metadata.icons.apple` (iOS)
- **Platform Focus**: Browser favicons (16x16, 32x32) and iOS (180x180)

#### 3. PWA Install Banner Component
**File**: `src/components/pwa-install-banner.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Custom install prompt with app icon preview
- **Icon Reference**: Direct `src` attribute in `<img>` tag
- **Platform Focus**: Small preview icon (typically 60x60 for 40px container)

#### 4. Player Portal Dynamic Meta Tags
**File**: `src/app/player-portal/[portalId]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Dynamically sets apple-touch-icon for iOS
- **Icon Reference**: `appleTouchIcon.href = "/path/to/icon.png"`
- **Platform Focus**: iOS apple-touch-icon (180x180)

#### Best Practices for Icon Updates

**Icon Size Requirements by Platform:**
- **Favicons**: 16x16, 32x32, 192x192
- **Apple Touch Icons**: 180x180 (primary), also 120x120, 152x152, 167x167
- **Android PWA**: 48x48, 72x72, 96x96, 144x144, 192x192, 512x512
- **Windows**: Various sizes from 44x44 to 1240x1240

**Update Process:**
1. Generate comprehensive icon set (use artwork/MadisonUltimateDiscLogo as reference)
2. Copy icons to `public/icons/` directory with organized subfolders
3. Update all four file locations listed above
4. Increment manifest version to force PWA cache refresh
5. Test across devices/browsers to verify icon display

**Cache Busting Strategy:**
- Increment `MANIFEST_VERSION` in manifest route
- Add version query parameters to icon URLs if needed
- Clear browser cache during testing

**iOS/Apple Special Treatment:**
- **Apple Touch Icons**: iOS ignores PWA manifest icons and requires separate apple-touch-icon meta tags
- **Required Sizes**: 180x180 (primary), 152x152 (iPad), 167x167 (iPad Pro), 120x120 (iPhone retina)
- **Safari Quirks**: iOS Safari caches apple-touch-icons aggressively - may need cache busting
- **PWA vs Browser**: Different icon requirements for PWA vs Safari browser bookmarks
- **Multiple Declarations**: iOS requires both layout.tsx metadata AND dynamic meta tags in player portal
- **Format Requirements**: iOS prefers PNG format, will convert SVG but may not cache properly

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Missing icon size for specific platforms
- Inconsistent icon paths across files
- Forgetting to increment manifest version
- Using wrong image format (prefer PNG for icons)
- Hardcoded paths that don't match actual file locations
- **iOS-Specific**: Not setting both static (layout.tsx) and dynamic (player portal) apple-touch-icons
- **iOS-Specific**: Using only PWA manifest icons without separate Apple meta tags
- **iOS-Specific**: Wrong apple-touch-icon sizes causing blurry icons on different iOS devices
