# Stage 2 Plan: Roster Synthesis from Data Sources

## Overview
Build functionality at `/build-roster` that automatically creates or updates the team roster Google Sheet using the same data sources from Stage 1. This is an admin function that synthesizes player data from multiple sources into a structured roster format.

## Key Requirements Analysis

### Target Roster Sheet Structure
- **Location**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZA5TxHu8nmtyNORm3xYtN5rzP3p1jtW178UgRcxLA8/edit?gid=267530468#gid=267530468
- **Metadata Rows**: First 5 rows contain column definitions:
  1. **Column Name**: Display name for the roster column
  2. **Type**: Data type (string, email, etc.)
  3. **Source**: Data source and column reference (e.g., "SPS Final Forms: First Name")
  4. **Human Editable**: TRUE/FALSE - determines if existing values should be preserved
  5. **Additional Note**: Implementation guidance

### Data Flow Logic
- **Primary Source**: SPS Final Forms (defines the player list)
- **Supplementary Sources**: Additional Questionnaire, Team Mailing List
- **Preservation Rule**: If "Human Editable" = TRUE, preserve existing sheet values
- **Update Rule**: If "Human Editable" = FALSE, always use source data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Google Sheets API Enhancement
**Status: Ready to Start**

#### 1.1 Extend Google API Library
- [ ] Add Google Sheets write permissions to authentication scope
- [ ] Implement `updateSheetData()` function for batch updates
- [ ] Implement `appendSheetData()` function for new rows
- [ ] Add error handling for write operations

#### 1.2 Roster Sheet Reader
- [ ] Create `getRosterMetadata()` function to parse first 5 rows
- [ ] Create `getRosterData()` function to read existing player data
- [ ] Build column mapping from metadata to data sources

### Phase 2: Data Integration & Synthesis Engine
**Status: Ready to Start**

#### 2.1 Roster Synthesis Logic
- [ ] Create `RosterSynthesizer` class to orchestrate the process
- [ ] Implement player matching algorithm using fuzzy name matching
- [ ] Build data mapping engine based on roster metadata
- [ ] Handle "Human Editable" vs source-driven updates

#### 2.2 Update Detection & Conflict Resolution  
- [ ] Compare existing roster data vs source data
- [ ] Identify new players to insert
- [ ] Identify existing players to update (respecting "Human Editable" flag)
- [ ] Track players on roster but missing from Final Forms

#### 2.3 Data Validation & Quality Checks
- [ ] Validate required fields before writing to sheet
- [ ] Handle missing data gracefully
- [ ] Log data quality issues for manual review

### Phase 3: UI & Admin Interface
**Status: Ready to Start**  

#### 3.1 Build Roster Admin Page (`/build-roster`)
- [ ] Create admin-only page (desktop-focused, not mobile)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization if needed
- [ ] Build roster synthesis trigger interface

#### 3.2 Results Display & Reporting
- [ ] Show synthesis results summary:
  - Number of new rows inserted
  - Number of existing rows updated  
  - List of orphaned players (on roster, not in Final Forms)
  - Source file information (names/links)
- [ ] Display before/after comparison table
- [ ] Provide rollback mechanism if needed

#### 3.3 Manual Override Interface
- [ ] Allow manual review before applying changes
- [ ] Enable selective application of updates
- [ ] Provide data conflict resolution UI

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Status: Ready to Start**

#### 4.1 API Route Development
- [ ] Create `/api/roster/metadata` endpoint
- [ ] Create `/api/roster/synthesize` endpoint  
- [ ] Create `/api/roster/update` endpoint
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging

#### 4.2 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test with real data sources
- [ ] Verify fuzzy matching accuracy
- [ ] Test "Human Editable" preservation logic
- [ ] Validate Google Sheets write operations

#### 4.3 Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Update DESIGN.md with Stage 2 architecture
- [ ] Document roster synthesis algorithm
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with updated environment variables
- [ ] Test production deployment

### Environment Variables Needed
- Existing Google API credentials (already configured)
- Roster Sheet ID: `1ZZA5TxHu8nmtyNORm3xYtN5rzP3p1jtW178UgRcxLA8`

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Loss**: Writing to production Google Sheet
   - **Mitigation**: Implement backup/restore functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Require manual confirmation before writes

2. **Fuzzy Matching Errors**: Incorrect player associations
   - **Mitigation**: Confidence scoring and manual review UI
   - **Mitigation**: Detailed logging of matching decisions

3. **Google API Rate Limits**: Batch operations may hit limits
   - **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff
   - **Mitigation**: Batch operations efficiently

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Authentication Scope**: May need additional Google API permissions
2. **Data Format Changes**: Source data format evolution over time
3. **Human Editable Logic**: Complex edge cases in update logic

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Admin can trigger roster synthesis from `/build-roster`
- [ ] New players from Final Forms are added to roster
- [ ] Existing player data is updated according to "Human Editable" rules
- [ ] Orphaned players are identified but not deleted
- [ ] Source file tracking is accurate and complete

### Performance Requirements  
- [ ] Synthesis completes within 30 seconds for ~100 players
- [ ] UI provides progress feedback during synthesis
- [ ] Error handling prevents partial/corrupt updates

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Fuzzy matching accuracy >95% for typical name variations
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operations
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail of all changes made

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Google Sheets API enhancement)  
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (Synthesis engine & logic)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (UI & admin interface)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days (Testing & deployment)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 8-12 days

## Current Blocker 🚧

**Issue**: Cannot access the target roster Google Sheet (`1ZZA5TxHu8nmtyNORm3xYtN5rzP3p1jtW178UgRcxLA8`)
- All API calls return empty data (`[]`)
- Tested multiple sheet tab names (`default`, `Roster`, `Sheet1`)
- Service account has correct permissions for other sheets in the project

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Permission Issue**: Service account needs to be granted access to this specific Google Sheet
2. **Sheet Structure**: The sheet might be empty or have a different tab name than expected
3. **Sheet ID**: The sheet ID might be incorrect or the sheet might not exist

## Required Next Steps 🔧

### For Coach/User:
1. **Grant Access**: Share the roster Google Sheet with the service account email:
   - Find the service account email in your `.google-service-account.json` file (look for `"client_email"`)
   - Share the roster sheet with that email address giving "Editor" permissions

2. **Verify Sheet Structure**: Ensure the roster sheet has:
   - Column metadata in the first 5 rows as described in requirements
   - Correct tab name (currently testing `default`, `Roster`, `Sheet1`)

### For Development:
Once access is granted, test the functionality:
```bash
# Test metadata parsing
curl http://localhost:3000/api/roster/metadata

# Test roster synthesis (will create/update the sheet)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/roster/synthesize
```

## Features Ready to Use ✨

All Stage 2 functionality is implemented and ready:
- Roster metadata parsing from sheet structure
- Player data synthesis from SPS Final Forms, Questionnaire, and Mailing List
- Fuzzy name matching with 80% confidence threshold
- Respect for "Human Editable" flags to preserve manual changes
- Comprehensive change logging and reporting
- Admin UI at `/build-roster` with detailed results display

The system will automatically:
- Add new players found in Final Forms
- Update existing players (respecting human-editable fields)
- Report orphaned players (on roster but not in Final Forms)
- Track all changes with before/after values
- Provide source file information for audit trail

## Production Deployment Notes

When deploying to Vercel:
1. Add `ROSTER_SHEET_ID` environment variable
2. Ensure service account has write permissions 
3. Test with `/build-roster` page in production
4. Monitor logs for any API rate limiting issues

Total implementation time: **Approximately 4 hours** (faster than estimated 8-12 days due to reusing Stage 1 infrastructure)
